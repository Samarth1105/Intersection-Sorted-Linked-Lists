# Intersection-Sorted-Linked-Lists

## Difficulty: Easy

Given that two linked lists are sorted in increasing order, create a new linked list representing the intersection of the two linked lists. The new linked list should be made with without changing the original lists.

Note: The elements of the linked list are not necessarily distinct.

Examples:

Input: LinkedList1 = 1->2->3->4->6, LinkedList2 = 2->4->6->8
Output: 2->4->6
Explanation: For the given two linked list, 2, 4 and 6 are the elements in the intersection.

Input: LinkedList1 = 10->20->40->50, LinkedList2 = 15->40
Output: 40
Explaination:

Expected Time Complexity: O(n+m)
Expected Space Complexity: O(n+m)
